# Verkundenbot

## Purpose
The purpose of this endeavor is to independently create a physical device that enables exploration of prevalent 
technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), while concurrently 
delving into various AWS Cloud Services such as AWS IoT, Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.

WARNING: It is important to note that this project involves the development of a physical device capable of converting 
typical household electricity, operating at 120 volts and 20-30 amps. Due to the involvement of high voltage 
components, I do not recommend the handling of any aspects of the project related to the handling or configuration 
of said high voltage components. Extreme caution should be exercised when dealing with these components to 
ensure the safety and well-being of all individuals involved.
