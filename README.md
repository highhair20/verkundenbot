# verkundenbot-device

The Verkundenbot Device is an AWS IoT enabled device.
  
The messages determine the state of the physical device.

## Hardware
For the purposes of this project I used a RaspberryPi 2 I had laying around.
Before we do anything else we should make sure we are running the latest
version of Raspian.

Begin by updating the repository package list:
```buildoutcfg
sudo apt update
```

When this is done, run the upgrade command:
```buildoutcfg
sudo apt dist-upgrade
```

Follow any prompts, and wait for the Pi to be upgraded. When you’re done, type:
```buildoutcfg
sudo apt clean
```

This will discard any unneeded files that have been downloaded as part of the upgrade. 
Finish by restarting:
```buildoutcfg
sudo reboot
```

When your Raspberry Pi has restarted, you’ll be using the latest version of Raspbian.


## Interfaces

#### Who will be communicating with Verkundenbot?
* __Datadog__ - we use Datadog as our monitoring system. Any critical alerts that are triggered 
should be sent to the device.
* __Deployments (Jenkings or AWS CodeBuild)__ - When we deploy code we want to notify the device so that we get an audible
alerting on what system was update and who made the change.
* __Verkundenbot Web App__ - There is a React web app where you can interect with the device.
You can control plugs A, B and C and you can send custom messages which will be converted
to voice and send through the speakers.
* __PagerDuty (future)__ - in the future we may move alerts from Datadog to PagerDuty. At which 
point we will want to move the webhook from Datadog to PagerDuty as well.  

#### How will the sources interact?
How will each source interact with the API and what do the 
requests look like?
* __Datadog__ - 
    * Sending alerts - /alarm
        * trigger the strobe for a short time
        * turn the status LED red
        * trigger an audible message
            * alarm sound once
            * "In store pixels are unstable" 
    * Re-Sending alerts - /alarm
        * trigger the strobe for a short time
        * turn the status LED red 
    * Sending Recovery message - /alarm
        * trigger the strobe for a short time
        * trigger audible message
            * play recover sound
            * "In store pixels have recovered"
        * turn the status LED blue
* __Deployments__ -
    * Doing a deployment - /deployment
        * trigger the strobe for a short time
        * "<first_name> <last_name> is deploying code to <service>"
        * once deployment completes
            * play mario bros sound
* __Verkundenbot Web App__ - /plug/{id}/{desired-state}
    * Trigger plug A from UI - /plug/a
        * turn on plug A
    * Trigger plug B from UI - /plug/b
        * turn on plug B
    * Trigger plug C from UI - /plug/c
        * turn on plug C
    * Message - /free-speach
        * play whatever message that's submitted
* __PagerDuty (future)__ - TDB
